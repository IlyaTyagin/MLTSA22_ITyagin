# MLTSA22 Homework 9 Readme file

My personal work.

I learned how to train an autoencoder and extract latent features from it.
I also experimented with different input formats and different classifiers. Random Forest produced okay-ish results.

PLASTiCC dataset we use is not the most friendly one to start with, but we learn a lot, sometimes in a hard way.
It was quite fun (and useful, I believe) to work with it, I hope this experience will be helpful for real-world applications.
