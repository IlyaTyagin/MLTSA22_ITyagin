# MLTSA22 Homework 6 Readme file

My personal work.

I learned how to find single POC automatically and implement simple algorithms based on different criteria (maximizing mean/std differences).
I also tried to use `ruptures` package and checked different models performing multi-POC search and applied them to real LANL earthquake data.
