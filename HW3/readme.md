# MLTSA22 Homework 3 Readme file

My personal work.

I learned about ARMA/ARIMA models, how to read and interpret (partial) autocorrelation plots and find optimal model parameters.
I spent a lot of time trying to make everything work on non-stationary models (it was not trivial because different versions of `statsmodels` package produce different errors), but I eventually figured it out.


I had to install custom versions of `statmodels` and `pandas` packages (they may conflict with each other for some reason)
and I included the versions I used in the notebook.
